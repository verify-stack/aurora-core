# ROJO/WALLY
aurora-core uses ROJO to host the source like lots of other projects.

To get started, install the VSCode plugin ROJO (make sure it's 7x).
<br>
After, install the ROBLOX plugin ROJO 7.

Do `CTRL+SHIFT+P`, go to `ROJO: Open Menu`, and click on host. Congrats, you've actually used something that can be published to git!

## WALLY
Current, aurora-core doesn't support Wally, nor will it ever. This is not a drop-in package module, it's a framework for legacy CoreScripts.
